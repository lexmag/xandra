defmodule Xandra.Cluster do
  @moduledoc """
  Connection to a Cassandra cluster.

  This module is a "proxy" connection with support for connecting to multiple
  nodes in a Cassandra cluster and executing queries on such nodes based on a
  given *policy*.

  ## Usage

  This module manages pools of connections to different nodes in a Cassandra cluster.
  Each pool is a pool of `Xandra` connections to a specific node.

  The API provided by this module mirrors the API provided by the `Xandra`
  module. Queries executed through this module will be "routed" to nodes
  in the provided list of nodes based on a policy. See the
  ["Load balancing policies" section](#module-load-balancing-policies).

  Regardless of the underlying pool, `Xandra.Cluster` will establish
  one extra connection to a node in the cluster for internal purposes.
  We refer to this connection as the **control connection**.

  Here is an example of how one could use `Xandra.Cluster` to connect to a cluster:

      Xandra.Cluster.start_link(
        nodes: ["cassandra1.example.net", "cassandra2.example.net"],
        pool_size: 10,
      )

  The code above will establish a pool of ten connections to each of the nodes
  specified in `:nodes`, plus one extra connection used for internal
  purposes, for a total of twenty-one connections going out of the machine.

  ## Child specification

  `Xandra.Cluster` implements a `child_spec/1` function, so it can be used as a child
  under a supervisor:

      children = [
        # ...,
        {Xandra.Cluster, nodes: ["cassandra-seed.example.net"]}
      ]

  ## Contact points and cluster discovery

  `Xandra.Cluster` auto-discovers peer nodes in the cluster, by using the `system.peers`
  built-in Cassandra table. Once Xandra discovers peers, it opens a pool of connections
  to a subset of the peers based on the chosen load-balancing policy (see below).

  The `:nodes` option in `start_link/1` specifies the **contact points**. The contact
  points are used to discover the rest of the nodes in the cluster. It's generally
  a good idea to provide multiple contacts points, so that if some of those are
  unreachable, the others can be used to discover the rest of the cluster. `Xandra.Cluster`
  tries to connect to contact points in the order they are specified in the `:nodes`
  option, initially ignoring the chosen load-balancing policy. Once a connection is
  established, then that contact point is used to discover the rest of the cluster
  and open connection pools according to the load-balancing policy.

  Xandra also **refreshes** the cluster topology periodically. See the
  `:refresh_topology_interval` option in `start_link/1`.

  ## Load-balancing policies

  `Xandra.Cluster` uses customizable "load-balancing policies" to manage nodes
  in the cluster. A load-balancing policy is a module that implements the
  `Xandra.Cluster.LoadBalancing` behaviour. Xandra uses load-balancing policies
  for these purposes:

    * Choosing which node to execute a query on
    * Choosing which nodes to open pools of connections to (see the `:target_pools`
      option in `start_link/1`)
    * Choosing which node the control connection connects to (or **re-connects** to
      in case of disconnections)

  Xandra ships with the following built-in load-balancing policies:

    * `Xandra.Cluster.LoadBalancingPolicy.Random` - it will choose one of the
      connected nodes at random and execute the query on that node.

  ## Disconnections and reconnections

  `Xandra.Cluster` also supports nodes disconnecting and reconnecting: if Xandra
  detects one of the nodes in `:nodes` going down, it will not execute queries
  against it anymore, but will start executing queries on it as soon as it
  detects such node is back up.

  If all specified nodes happen to be down when a query is executed, a
  `Xandra.ConnectionError` with reason `{:cluster, :not_connected}` will be
  returned.

  ## Telemetry

  This section describes all the Telemetry events that `Xandra.Cluster` emits. These events
  are available since *v0.15.0*. See also `Xandra.Telemetry`.

  * `[:xandra, :cluster, :change_event]` — emitted when there is a change in the
    cluster, either as reported by Cassandra itself or as detected by Xandra.

    **Measurements**: *none*.

    **Metadata**:
      * `:event_type` - one of `:host_up` (a host went up), `:host_down` (a host went down),
        `:host_added` (a host was added to the cluster topology), or `:host_removed` (a host
        was removed from the cluster topology).
      * `:source` - one of `:cassandra` or `:xandra`. If the event was reported by
        Cassandra itself, the source is `:cassandra`. If the event was detected by
        Xandra, the source is `:xandra`.
      * `:changed` (`t:boolean/0`) - this is `true` if the node wasn't in the state
        reported by the event, and `false` if the node was already in the reported state.
      * `:host` (`t:Xandra.Cluster.Host.t/0`) - the host that went up or down.
      * `:cluster_pid` (`t:pid/0`) - the PID of the cluster process.
      * `:cluster_name` - the name of the cluster executing the event, if provided
        through the `:name` option in `start_link/1`. `nil` if no `:name` was provided.

  * `[:xandra, :cluster, :control_connection, :connected]` — emitted when the control
    connection for the cluster is established.

    **Measurements**: *none*.

    **Metadata**:
      * `:host` (`t:Xandra.Cluster.Host.t/0`) - the host that the control connection is
        connected to.
      * `:cluster_pid` (`t:pid/0`) - the PID of the cluster process.
      * `:cluster_name` - the name of the cluster executing the event, if provided
        through the `:name` option in `start_link/1`. `nil` if no `:name` was provided.

  * `[:xandra, :cluster, :control_connection, :disconnected]` — emitted when the control
    connection for the cluster is established.

    **Measurements**: *none*.

    **Metadata**:
      * `:host` (`t:Xandra.Cluster.Host.t/0`) - the host that the control connection is
        connected to.
      * `:reason` - the reason for the disconnection. For example, `:closed` if the connected
        node closes the connection peacefully.
      * `:cluster_pid` (`t:pid/0`) - the PID of the cluster process.
      * `:cluster_name` - the name of the cluster executing the event, if provided
        through the `:name` option in `start_link/1`. `nil` if no `:name` was provided.

  Same as `Xandra.prepare/3`.

  Preparing a query through `Xandra.Cluster` will prepare it only on one node,
  according to the load-balancing policy chosen in `start_link/1`. To prepare
  and execute a query on the same node, you could use `run/3`:

      Xandra.Cluster.run(cluster, fn conn ->
        # "conn" is the pool of connections for a specific node.
        prepared = Xandra.prepare!(conn, "SELECT * FROM system.local")
        Xandra.execute!(conn, prepared, _params = [])
      end)

  Thanks to the prepared query cache, we can always reprepare the query and execute
  it because after the first time (on each node) the prepared query will be fetched
  from the cache. However, if a prepared query is unknown on a node, Xandra will
  prepare it on that node on the fly, so we can simply do this as well:

      prepared = Xandra.Cluster.prepare!(cluster, "SELECT * FROM system.local")
      Xandra.Cluster.execute!(cluster, prepared, _params = [])

  Note that this goes through the cluster twice, so there's a high chance that
  the query will be prepared on one node and then executed on another node.
  This is however useful if you want to use the `:retry_strategy` option in
  `execute!/4`: in the `run/3` example above, if you use `:retry_strategy` with
  `Xandra.execute!/3`, the query will be retried on the same pool of connections
  to the same node. `execute!/4` will retry queries going through the cluster
  again instead.
