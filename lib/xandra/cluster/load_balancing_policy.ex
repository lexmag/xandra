  A behaviour for defining load-balancing policies.

  A load-balancing policy is a way to tell Xandra which nodes to query when connected
  to a cluster.

  For example, a simple load-balancing policy is `Xandra.Cluster.LoadBalancingPolicy.Random`,
  which picks a random node for each query out of the ones that are up.
