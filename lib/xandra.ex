defmodule Xandra do
  @moduledoc """
  This module provides the main API to interface with Cassandra.

  This module handles the connection to Cassandra, queries, connection pooling,
  connection backoff, logging, and more. Some of these features are provided by
  the [`DBConnection`](https://hex.pm/packages/db_connection) library, which
  Xandra is built on top of.

  ## Errors

  Many of the functions in this module (whose names don't end with a `!`)
  return values in the form `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, error}`. While `result`
  varies based on the specific function, `error` is always one of the following:

    * a `Xandra.Error` struct: such structs represent errors returned by
      Cassandra. When such an error is returned, it means that communicating
      with the Cassandra server was successful, but the server returned an
      error. Examples of these errors are syntax errors in queries, non-existent
      tables, and so on. See `Xandra.Error` for more information.

    * a `Xandra.ConnectionError` struct: such structs represent errors in the
      communication with the Cassandra server. For example, if the Cassandra
      server dies while the connection is waiting for a response from the
      server, a `Xandra.ConnectionError` error will be returned. See
      `Xandra.ConnectionError` for more information.

  ## Parameters, encoding, and types

  Xandra supports parameterized queries (queries that specify "parameter" values
  through `?` or `:named_value`):

      SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND email = ?
      SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :name AND email = :email

  When a query has positional parameters, parameters can be passed as a list to
  functions like `execute/4`: in this case, a parameter in a given position in
  the list will be used as the `?` in the corresponding position in the
  query. When a query has named parameters, parameters are passed as a map with
  string keys representing each parameter's name and values representing the
  corresponding parameter's value.

  ### Types

  For information about how Elixir types translate to Cassandra types and
  viceversa, see the ["Data types comparison table" page](data-types-comparison-table.html).

  Cassandra supports many types of values, and some types have "shades" that
  cannot be represented by Elixir types. For example, in Cassandra an integer
  could be a "bigint" (a 64 bit integer), an "int" (a 32 bit integer), a
  "smallint" (a 16 bit integer), or others; in Elixir, however, integers are
  just integers (with varying size to be precise), so it is impossible to
  univocally map Elixir integers to a specific Cassandra integer type. For this
  reason, when executing simple parameterized queries (statements) it is
  necessary to explicitly specify the type of each value.

  To specify the type of a value, that value needs to be provided as a
  two-element tuple where the first element is the value's type and the second
  element is the value itself. Types are expressed with the same syntax used in
  CQL: for example, 16-bit integers are represented as `"smallint"`, while maps
  of strings to booleans are represented as `"map<text, boolean>"`.

      # Using a list of parameters:
      statement = "INSERT INTO species (name, properties) VALUES (?, ?)"
      Xandra.execute(conn, statement, [
        {"text", "human"},
        {"map<text, boolean>", %{"legs" => true, "arms" => true, "tail" => false}},
      ])

      # Using a map of parameters:
      statement = "INSERT INTO species (name, properties) VALUES (:name, :properties)"
      Xandra.execute(conn, statement, %{
        "name" => {"text", "human"},
        "properties" => {"map<text, boolean>", %{"legs" => true, "arms" => true, "tail" => false}},
      })

  You only need to specify types for simple queries (statements): when using
  prepared queries, the type information of each parameter of the query is
  encoded in the prepared query itself.

      # Using a map of parameters:
      prepared = Xandra.prepare!(conn, "INSERT INTO species (name, properties) VALUES (:name, :properties)")
      Xandra.execute(conn, prepared, %{
        "name" => "human",
        "properties" => %{"legs" => true, "arms" => true, "tail" => false},
      })

  #### User-defined types

  Xandra supports user-defined types (UDTs). A UDT can be inserted as a map with
  string fields. For example, consider having created the following UDTs:

      CREATE TYPE full_name (first_name text, last_name text)
      CREATE TYPE profile (username text, full_name frozen<full_name>)

  and having the following table:

      CREATE TABLE users (id int PRIMARY KEY, profile frozen<profile>)

  Inserting rows will look something like this:

      prepared_insert = Xandra.prepare!(conn, "INSERT INTO users (id, profile) VALUES (?, ?)")

      profile = %{
        "username" => "bperry",
        "full_name" => %{"first_name" => "Britta", "last_name" => "Perry"},
      }
      Xandra.execute!(conn, prepared_insert, [_id = 1, profile])

  Note that inserting UDTs is only supported on prepared queries.

  When retrieved, UDTs are once again represented as maps with string
  keys. Retrieving the row inserted above would look like this:

      %{"profile" => profile} = conn |> Xandra.execute!("SELECT id, profile FROM users") |> Enum.fetch!(0)
      profile
      #=> %{"username" => "bperry", "full_name" => %{"first_name" => "Britta", "last_name" => "Perry"}}

  ### Values

  Xandra supports two special values: `nil` and `:not_set`. Using `nil` explicitly
  inserts a `null` value into the Cassandra table. This is useful to **delete a value** while
  inserting. Note however that explicitly inserting `null` values into Cassandra creates so
  called *tombstones* which negatively affects performance and resource utilisation and is
  thus usually not recommended.

  The `:not_set` value is a special value that allows to leave the value of a parametrized query
  *unset*, telling Cassandra not to insert anything for the given field. In contrast to explicit
  `null` values, no tombstone is created for this field. This is useful for prepared queries with
  optional fields. The `:not_set` value requires Cassandra native protocol v4, available since
  Cassandra `2.2.x`. You can force the protocol version to v4 with the `:protocol_version`
  option.

  ## Reconnections

  Thanks to the `DBConnection` library, Xandra is able to handle connection
  losses and to automatically reconnect to Cassandra. By default, reconnections
  are retried at exponentially increasing randomized intervals, but backoff can
  be configured through a subset of the options accepted by
  `start_link/2`. These options are described in the documentation for
  `DBConnection.start_link/2`.

  ## Clustering

  Xandra supports connecting to multiple nodes in a Cassandra cluster and
  executing queries on different nodes based on load balancing strategies. See
  the documentation for `Xandra.Cluster` for more information.

  ## Authentication

  Xandra supports Cassandra authentication. See the documentation for
  `Xandra.Authenticator` for more information.

  ## Retrying failed queries

  Xandra takes a customizable and extensible approach to retrying failed queries
  through "retry strategies" that encapsulate the logic for retrying
  queries. See `Xandra.RetryStrategy` for documentation on retry strategies.

  ## Compression

  Xandra supports compression. To inform the Cassandra server that the
  connections you start should use compression for data transmitted to and from
  the server, you can pass the `:compressor` option to `start_link/1`; this
  option should be a module that implements the `Xandra.Compressor`
  behaviour. After this, all compressed data that Cassandra sends to the
  connection will be decompressed using this behaviour module.

  To compress outgoing data (such as when issuing or preparing queries), the behavior
  of Xandra depends on the native protocol that it negotiated with the Cassandra server.
  For native protocol v4 and earlier, the `:compressor` option should be specified
  explicitly for every request where you want outgoing compressor. When it's specified, the
  given module will be used to compress data. If no `:compressor` option is
  passed, the outgoing data will not be compressed. For native protocol v5 or later,
  Xandra compresses all outgoing data since compression happens at the connection level,
  so it's not necessary to pass the `:compressor` option when preparing or executing queries.
  It's still good practice to pass it around so that your code stays agnostic of the
  native protocol being used.

  ## Native protocol

  Xandra supports the following versions of Cassandra's native protocol:
  #{Enum.join(Xandra.Frame.supported_protocols(), ", ")}.

  By default, Xandra will negotiate the protocol version with the Cassandra server.
  Xandra will start by trying to use the highest protocol it supports (which is
  #{Xandra.Frame.max_supported_protocol()}). If the server rejects that, then
  Xandra will reconnect with the protocol advertised by the server. If you
  want to force a specific version of the native protocol that Xandra should use,
  use the `:protocol_version` option.

  ## Logging

  Xandra connections log a few events like disconnections or connection failures.
  Logs contain the `:xandra_address` and `:xandra_port` metadata that you can
  choose to log if desired.

  ## Custom payloads

  The Cassandra native protocol supports exchanging **custom payloads** between
  server and client. A custom payload is a map of string keys to binary values
  (`t:custom_payload/0`).

  To *send* custom payloads to the server, you can pass the `:custom_payload`
  option to functions such as `prepare/3` and `execute/4`.

  If the server sends a custom payload in a response (`t:result/0`), you'll find
  it in the `:custom_payload` field of the corresponding struct (such as
  `Xandra.Page`, `Xandra.Void`, and so on).

  By default, Cassandra itself ignores custom payloads sent to the server. Other
  implementations built on top of the Cassandra native protocol might use
  custom payloads to provide implementation-specific functionality. One such
  example is Azure [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/).

  Starts a new pool of connections to Cassandra.

  This function starts a new connection or pool of connections to the provided

  ## Options

  These are the Xandra-specific options supported by this function:

  #{NimbleOptions.docs(@start_link_opts_schema)}

  The rest of the options are forwarded to `DBConnection.start_link/2`. For
  example, to start a pool of five connections, you can use the `:pool_size`
  option:

      Xandra.start_link(pool_size: 5)

      # Start a connection:
      {:ok, conn} = Xandra.start_link()

      # Start a connection and register it under a name:

  If you're using Xandra under a supervisor, see `Xandra.child_spec/1`.

  ### Using a keyspace for new connections

  It is common to start a Xandra connection or pool of connections that will use
  a single keyspace for their whole life span. Doing something like:

      {:ok, conn} = Xandra.start_link()
      Xandra.execute!(conn, "USE my_keyspace")

  will work just fine when you only have one connection. If you have a pool of
  connections more than one connection, however, the code above won't work:
  it would start the pool and then checkout one connection from the pool
  to execute the `USE my_keyspace` query. That specific connection will then be
  using the `my_keyspace` keyspace, but all other connections in the pool will
  not. Fortunately, `DBConnection` provides an option we can use to solve this
  problem: `:after_connect`. This option can specify a function that will be run
  after each single connection to Cassandra. This function will take a
  connection and can be used to setup that connection. Since this function is
  run for every established connection, it will work well with pools as well.

      after_connect_fun = fn conn ->
        Xandra.execute!(conn, "USE my_keyspace")
      end

      {:ok, conn} = Xandra.start_link(after_connect: after_connect_fun)

  See the documentation for `DBConnection.start_link/2` for more information
  about this option.

  Since Cassandra prepares queries on a per-node basis (and not on a
  per-connection basis), Xandra internally caches prepared queries for each
  connection or pool of connections. This means that if you prepare a query that
  was already prepared, no action will be executed on the Cassandra server and
  the prepared query will be returned from the cache.

  If the Cassandra node goes down, however, the prepared query will be
  invalidated and trying to use the one from cache will result in a
  `Xandra.Error`. However, this is automatically handled by Xandra: when such an
  error is returned, Xandra will first retry to prepare the query and only
  return an error if the preparation fails.

  If you want to ensure a query is prepared on the server, you can set the
  `:force` option to `true`.

  ## Examples

      {:ok, prepared} = Xandra.prepare(conn, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
      {:ok, _page} = Xandra.execute(conn, prepared, [_id = 1])

      {:error, %Xandra.Error{reason: :invalid_syntax}} = Xandra.prepare(conn, "bad syntax")

  Executes the given simple query, prepared query, or batch query.

  Returns `{:ok, result}` if executing the query was successful, or `{:error,
  error}` otherwise. The meaning of the `params_or_options` argument depends on
  what `query` is:

    * if `query` is a batch query, than `params_or_options` has to be a list of
      options that will be used to run the batch query (since batch queries
      don't use parameters as parameters are attached to each query in the
      batch).

    * if `query` is a simple query (a string) or a prepared query, then
      `params_or_opts` is a list or map of parameters, and this function is
      exactly the same as calling `execute(conn, query, params_or_options, [])`.

  When `query` is a batch query, successful results will always be `Xandra.Void`
  structs.

  When `{:error, error}` is returned, `error` can be either a `Xandra.Error` or
  a `Xandra.ConnectionError` struct. See the module documentation for more
  information on errors.

  ## Options for batch queries

  When `query` is a batch query, `params_or_options` is a list of options. All
  options supported by `DBConnection.execute/4` are supported, and the following
  additional batch-specific options:

    * `:consistency` - same as the `:consistency` option described in the
      documentation for `execute/4`.

    * `:serial_consistency` - same as the `:serial_consistency` option described
      in the documentation for `execute/4`.

    * `:timestamp` - using this option means that the provided
      timestamp will apply to all the statements in the batch that do not
      explicitly specify a timestamp.

  ## Examples

  For examples on executing simple queries or prepared queries, see the
  documentation for `execute/4`. Examples below specifically refer to batch
  queries. See the documentation for `Xandra.Batch` for more information about
  batch queries and how to construct them.

  Executes the given simple query or prepared query with the given parameters.

  Returns `{:ok, result}` where `result` is the result of executing `query` if
  the execution is successful (there are no network errors or semantic errors
  with the query), or `{:error, error}` otherwise.

  `result` can be one of the following:

    * a `Xandra.Void` struct - returned for queries such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
      or `DELETE`.

    * a `Xandra.SchemaChange` struct - returned for queries that perform changes
      on the schema (such as creating tables).

    * a `Xandra.SetKeyspace` struct - returned for `USE` queries.

    * a `Xandra.Page` struct - returned for queries that return rows (such as
      `SELECT` queries).

  The properties of each of the results listed above are described in each
  result's module.

  ## Options

  This function accepts all options accepted by `DBConnection.execute/4`, plus
  the following ones:

  #{NimbleOptions.docs(@execute_opts_schema)}

  ## Parameters

  The `params` argument specifies parameters to use when executing the query; it
  can be either a list of positional parameters (specified via `?` in the query)
  or a map of named parameters (specified as `:named_parameter` in the
  query). When `query` is a simple query, the value of each parameter must be a
  two-element tuple specifying the type used to encode the value and the value
  itself; when `query` is a prepared query, this is not necessary (and values
  can just be values) as the type information is encoded in the prepared
  query. See the module documentation for more information about query
  parameters, types, and encoding values.

  ## Examples

  Executing a simple query (which is just a string):

      statement = "INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES (:first_name, :last_name)"

      {:ok, %Xandra.Void{}} =
        Xandra.execute(conn, statement, %{
          "first_name" => {"text", "Chandler"},
          "last_name" => {"text", "Bing"},
        })

  Executing the query when `atom_keys: true` has been specified in `Xandra.start_link/1`:

      Xandra.execute(conn, statement, %{
        first_name: {"text", "Chandler"},
        last_name: {"text", "Bing"}
      })

  Executing a prepared query:

      prepared = Xandra.prepare!(conn, "INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES (?, ?)")

      {:ok, %Xandra.Void{}} = Xandra.execute(conn, prepared, ["Monica", "Geller"])

  Performing a `SELECT` query and using `Enum.to_list/1` to convert the
  `Xandra.Page` result to a list of rows:

      statement = "SELECT * FROM users"
      {:ok, %Xandra.Page{} = page} = Xandra.execute(conn, statement, _params = [])
      Enum.to_list(page)
      #=> [%{"first_name" => "Chandler", "last_name" => "Bing"},
      #=>  %{"first_name" => "Monica", "last_name" => "Geller"}]

  Performing the query when `atom_keys: true` has been specified in `Xandra.start_link/1`:

      {:ok, page} = Xandra.execute(conn, statement, _params = [])
      Enum.to_list(page)
      #=> [%{first_name:  "Chandler", last_name: "Bing"},
      #=>  %{first_name: "Monica", last_name: "Geller"}]

  Ensuring the write is written to the commit log and memtable of at least three replica nodes:

      statement = "INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Chandler', 'Bing')"
      {:ok, %Xandra.Void{}} = Xandra.execute(conn, statement, _params = [], consistency: :three)

  This function supports all options supported by `DBConnection.execute/4`; for
  example, to use a timeout:

      statement = "DELETE FROM users WHERE first_name = 'Chandler'"
      {:ok, %Xandra.Void{}} = Xandra.execute(conn, statement, _params = [], timeout: 10_000)

  ## Paging

  Since `execute/4` supports the `:paging_state` option, it is possible to manually
  implement paging. For example, given the following prepared query:

      prepared = Xandra.prepare!(conn, "SELECT first_name FROM users")

  We can now execute such query with a specific page size using the `:page_size`
  option:

      {:ok, %Xandra.Page{} = page} = Xandra.execute(conn, prepared, [], page_size: 2)

  Since `:page_size` is `2`, `page` will contain at most `2` rows:

      Enum.to_list(page)
      #=> [%{"first_name" => "Ross"}, %{"first_name" => "Rachel"}]

  Now, we can pass `page.paging_state` as the value of the `:paging_state`
  option to let the paging start from where we left off:

      {:ok, %Xandra.Page{} = new_page} =
        Xandra.execute(conn, prepared, [], page_size: 2, paging_state: page.paging_state)

      Enum.to_list(page)
      #=> [%{"first_name" => "Joey"}, %{"first_name" => "Phoebe"}]

  However, using `:paging_state` and `:page_size` directly with `execute/4` is not
  recommended when the intent is to "stream" a query. For that, it's recommended
  to use `stream_pages!/4`. Also note that if the `:paging_state` option is set to `nil`,
  meaning there are no more pages to fetch, an `ArgumentError` exception will be raised;
  be sure to check for this with `page.paging_state != nil`.

  ## Tracing

  Cassandra supports [tracing queries](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_reference/cqlshTracing.html).
  If you set the `:tracing` option to `true`, the executed query will be traced.
  This means that a tracing ID (a binary UUID) will be set in the response of the query
  and that Cassandra will write relevant tracing events to tracing-related tables in the
  `system_traces` keyspace.

  In Xandra, all response structs contain an accessible `tracing_id` field that is set
  to `nil` except for when tracing is enabled. In those cases, `tracing_id` is a binary
  UUID that you can use to select events from the traces tables.

  For example:

      {:ok, page} = Xandra.execute(conn, "SELECT * FROM users", [], tracing: true)

      statement = "SELECT * FROM system_traces.events WHERE session_id = ?"
      {:ok, trace_events_page} = Xandra.execute(conn, statement, [{"uuid", page.tracing_id}])

  Note that tracing is an expensive operation for Cassandra that puts load on
  executing queries. This is why this option is only supported *per-query* in
  `execute/4` instead of connection-wide.
